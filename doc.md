Portfolio Requirements:
Upon completion of this course you will :

Create a series of wireframes for your site (also referred to as a "portfolio")

Generate original content

Use the proper semantic and syntactic HTML tags to display your content

Apply CSS to your content to create a stylish and accessible site

Write media queries and/or use a framework to create a responsive site

Implement four "extras" that demonstrate the ability to apply web design theory or practice (JavaScript, plugins, Accessibility features, animation, etc.)

Additional requirements:
Each page must have at least two semantic tags (header, nav, footer, etc)

Each page must validate at 
validator.w3.org

Each page must be responsive -- there must be at least three unique views

You must have at least 4 images on one of your pages

If this requirement doesn't "fit" your portfolio plan, please just make an extra page that fulfills it. You can always unlink it after you have been peer-graded.

Each page must be styled

The goal is not to impress, but to show competence. So add enough to show that you know how to write CSS rules. But peer-review with the knowledge that not everything will be beautiful.
